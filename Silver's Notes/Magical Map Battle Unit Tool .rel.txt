Written by @silver_136. Feel free to reach out to me on discord with any information, corrections, changes, additions, etc. that you find.
Thanks to @jemaroo for the battle tool, it made testing significantly easier. Also thanks for assisting in figuring out what some flags do.
Thanks to @jdaster64 for various documentation that was referenced while writing this.
Thanks to @cursed_gm, @hirothetraveler,and @reed for various assistance and ideas in figuring out what some flags do.

---All enemies found in the various .rel files---
This document is going to focus on all of the different enemies found in every .rel. Since various enemies appear in more than 1 .rel file the enemies will be only appear once and it will be done in the order the Tattle Log shows them. Enemies that don't appear in the Tattle Log such as Fuzzy Horde, X-Punch, etc. will be placed right after the respective enemy/boss they belong to.

---Universal---
Various behaviors are universal on enemies, to avoid redundancy they will all be listed here. If enemies have more than 1 of the various structs, those will be documented with the respective enemy.
•If an enemy does not have a particular struct noted (EX. Kind Struct 1, Part Struct 1, Defense Struct 1, Defense Attributes Struct 1, or Status Vulnerability Struct 1) then assume it has no special properties and just applies to whatever entity it is tied to. EX. Goomba only has 1 part struct, so it goes unmentioned since it has no special cases or behaviors, it applies to the Goomba as a whole. Other enemies that have more than 1 part, EX. Paragoomba, will note any unique part structs, but not the default one.
•Base Damage Parameter 1 - This sets the damage of the attack. Parameters 2-8 do nothing.
•Base FP Damage Parameter 1 - This only functions on Flower Fuzzy in vanilla. On all other enemies it does nothing. Parameters 2-8 do nothing.
•Most other flags including Statuses, Stage Effects, and targeting rules apply. See the Universal Flags.txt for details, most flags that don't work on enemies are noted there.
