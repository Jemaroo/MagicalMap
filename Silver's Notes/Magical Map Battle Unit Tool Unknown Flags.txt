---Unused/Unknown Flags---
This document focuses on flags that are unknown or go unused in the game. Many of them function and have since been figured out and added to the battle tool, however they are still being documented separately here since they may have other undiscovered behaviors or side effects.

-=Kind Struct Flags=-

•Is Map Object (UAF 0x1) - Sets actors position to 300 units back. This has an in-game effect of making that target no longer frontmost if other enemies are in the battle. If a part has "Ignore Map Object Offset (PAF 0x20000)" enabled then (UAF 0x1) is ignored.
•Is Invisible (UAF 0x8) - Makes the target invisible. Seems to just be the invisible status, moves will miss unless the flag "Cannot Miss" is enabled.
•Never Targetable (UAF 0x40) - Makes the target untargetable with any attacks. Seems to even stop the target from having items used on them, and seems to stop stage props from targeting the target.
•Limit Switch (UAF 0x100) - Unknown.
•Immune to Spin Hammer Knockback (UAF 0x4000) - Makes the target immune to knockback from Super/Ultra Hammer.
•Is Undead (UAF 0x10000) - When enabled stops the target from dying when they reach 0HP. 
•Is Corpse (UAF 0x20000) - This flag is used when any of the Dry Bones variants are in their "downed" state.
•Is Leader (UAF 0x40000) - Designates target as a "leader". All "leaders" must be defeated on Mario's side for a game over to occur. If enabled on a partner then it is possible for a fight to continue even if Mario is downed. This flag seems to have no effect on enemies. Note, if no one on Mario's side is designated as a "leader" then a game over happens immediately.
•Cannot Take Actions (UAF 0x80000) - When enabled on a target it prevents them from taking any actions. Function on enemies and Mario/Partner. They can not attack and if enabled on a boss with a phase change mid fight, like chapter 4 Doopliss, he won't transform into Shadow Mario until he reaches 0 HP, instead of 10 or lower.
•Not Spun by Love Slap (UAF 0x200000) - When set the target is immune to the visual effect of the Love Slap damage patterns "Spin Once 1/2" and "Quickly Spin 1/2".
•Disable Damage Stars (UAF 0x400000) - When set the target does not display the damage stars and number when taking damage.
•Disable All Part Visibility (UAF 0x1000000) - When enabled this flag disables the visibility of all parts relating to the target. This flag is a universal version of "Disable Part Visibility (PAF 0x1000000)", instead of being per part it applies to the entire target.
•Disable HP Gauge (UAF 0x2000000) - Disables the HP Gauge in battle.
•Look Camera (UAF 0x4000000) - Unknown. Only on Swooper, Swoopula, and Swampire.
•Non-Combatant (UAF 0x10000000) - Designates the target as a non-combatant.
•No Shadow (UAF 0x20000000) - Disables the visibility of the targets shadow.

-=Part Struct Flags=-

•(PAF 0x8) - Unknown, set on many entities by default.
•Ignore Only Target Select Parts (PAF 0x10) - When this flag is enabled the part becomes immune to any attack with the flag "Only Target Select Parts (TCF 0x200000)". By Default the "Only Target Select Parts (TCF 0x200000)" flag is only enabled on Bomb Squad, so this flag would only give immunity to that attack. However, if you were to disable "Only Target Select Parts" on Bomb Squad you could have a similar circumstance to "Unused Attack Type 1" and "Unused Immunity Type 1", where an attack can be a "Type" and an entity can have an immunity to that "Type".
•Is Frontmost (PAF 0x40) - (Assumed) Sets the target to always be "frontmost". This seems to cause most if not all attacks to miss. If the target is not in the front then any moves that have the "Can Only Target Frontmost" flag will be able to target the actual front entity or the entity with this flag enabled. The only attacks that seem to do damage are star powers. If the flag "Cannot Miss" is enabled on an attack then said attack will do damage instead of missing.
•Is Clone-like (PAF 0x4000) - Makes an enemy clone-like, similar to a Wizzerd/Magikoopa clone. If used on an enemy that can't normally clone they can not be targeted unless an attack has the "Can Hit Clone-like (SPF 0x40000)" flag. An enemy with "Is Clone-like" must be dropped to 0HP to be defeated, unlike regular clones which disappear on contact. The target can still be superguarded and damage will still apply. Lastly, the flag "Cannot Miss" does not make an attack hit an enemy with "Is Clone-like".
•Disable Flat Paper Layering (PAF 0x8000) - When enabled makes an invisible target appear strangely, the model is no longer flattened. Enabling on an target that has it disabled by default changes nothing about the invisible status. This flag also makes the Dodgy idle animation not play, however the Dodgy dodge animation still plays.
•Ignore Map Object Offset (PAF 0x20000) - This flag ignores the offset from "Is Map Object". 
•"Only Target Preferred Parts TCF 0x100000" And "Only Target Select Parts TCF 0x200000" Immunity (PAF 0x40000) - This flag gives the target immunity to both of the flags listed. Seems to be a variant on "Only Target Select Parts Immunity (PAF 0x10)" that includes immunity to "Only Target Preferred Parts TCF 0x100000".
•Prevent Health Decrease (PAF 0x800000) - This flag sets the target to be immune to taking damage. Does not prevent damage numbers from appearing, but health will not lower. Unlike "Is Immune To Damage And Status", this flag still allows statuses to be inflicted, but statuses that do damage will not deal damage. The only way to defeat a target with this flag seems to be Gale/OHKO/Fright.
•Disable Part Visibility (PAF 0x1000000) - When enabled this flag disables the visibility of the model the Part Struct is related to. EX. Shadow Queen has 5 Parts, and each one relates to a different part of her body, enabling this flag makes that part invisible. For example, enabling this flag on Part Struct 1 will make Shadow Peach invisible.
•Is Immune To Custom Type (PAF 0x2000000) - This flag prevents attacks with the flag "Cannot Target Custom Type (TPF 0x4000000)" from targeting the entity. This flag functions on Mario/Partner and enemies. This flag has a side effect of disabling some animations and shadows.
•Blur On (PAF 0x4000000) - Not enabled on anything by default.
•Scale Independence (PAF 0x8000000) - Not enabled on anything by default.
•Independence (PAF 0x10000000) - Seems to be used on certain parts to handle moving objects. EX. When disabled on X-Naut PHD part struct 2 the thrown bottle will no longer travel to Mario, but just teleport instead.

-=Attack Flags=-

•Cannot Target Tree Or Switch (TCF 0x20) - Seems to go unused, enabled on all attacks, disabling seems to change nothing.
•Cannot Target System Units (TCF 0x40) - Prevents the attack from targeting system units. If this flag is disabled along with some other target related flags you will be able to attack the "stage", with a hitbox/target in the center of the stage. It can not be defeated regardless of health or statuses, except for with Gulp. When Gulp is used on System then System will disappear from the stage, with seemingly no other side effects. If you set System to have a level and give Star Points then it will give you the appropriate amount of Star Points. Note that system can only be targeted if the "Never Targetable" flag is disabled in its part struct. Note 2, Bomb Squad counts as a system unit, so if an attack has this flag disabled, said attack can target Bomb Squad bombs.
•Only Target Tree Or Switch (TCFx20000) - Makes the attack only able to target Tree or Switch, since these don't exist it disables targeting for this move.
•Only Target Preferred Parts (TCF 0x100000) - Makes the selected attack only able to target certain parts. This flag seems to only matter in fights with enemies that have multiple parts. Seems to disable targeting on Cortez Bone Pile, Cortez Gem, Magnus Feet, Magnus 2.0 Feet, Grodus' Staff, and All 3 of the Dragons feet, however those targets only seem to be disabled if the attack has another target it can hit. EX. Jump can target Cortez Head and Bone Pile, so with this flag enabled Bone Pile loses its targeting. However Hammer can not reach Cortez Head, so Bone Pile remains a target. Also, multitarget moves such as Multibounce and Quake Hammer have this enabled by default and disabling it allows Cortez Head, Bone Pile, and Gem to all be targeted at once. This flag is also the reason Fire Drive is the only multitarget that can target Grodus' Staff, since every other multi-part boss has one target in the air and one on the ground you would never see it, but Grodus and his Staff are both grounded, and Fire Drive doesn't have this flag set, thus letting Fire Drive hit both.
•Only Target Select Parts (TCF 0x200000) - Makes the attack only able to target certain parts. Only used on Bomb Squad in vanilla, and seems to disable hitting multiple parts on bosses that have them. EX. With this flag disabled on Bomb Squad you can target Magnus/Magnus 2.0 feet and body, or Grodus and his Staff, getting 2 hits per bomb.
•Cannot Target Anything (TCF 0x80000000) - Completely disables targeting options for the attack. 
•Cannot Target Floating 1 (TPF 0x2) - Seems to disable targeting entities that are floating or flying. EX. Boos, Paragoombas, Wizzerds, Embers. This flag is normally only set on Fuzzy Horde, and that enemy can not target Flurrie, who is floating. This flag does not disable targeting enemies on the ceiling. There seem to be no enemies or statuses that are different between "Cannot Target Floating 1" (The one only on Fuzzy Horde) and "Cannot Target Floating 2" (The one used by literally everything else).
•Cannot Target Grounded 2 (TPF 0x8000) - Seems to be a duplicate of "cannot target grounded". There are no differences in behavior for "Cannot Target Grounded" and "Cannot Target Grounded Variant"
•Cannot Target Shell Shield (TPF 0x2000000) - Seems to disable targeting entities with a Shell Shield. This flag is slightly different than "Cannot Target Mario or Shell Shield" since it does not prevent targeting Mario, however if Mario is under a Shell Shield and an attack could normally target him is used (EX. Smooch) the attack will not be able to target Mario. Note that this flag seems to have no impact on enemy attacks. This flag does function if you Shell Shield an enemy, the attack with this flag won't be able to target the enemy at all. However enemy attacks will target their own side if a Shell Shield is up on their side. Lastly, this flag does work on items, but only those used by Mario/Partner. If you have this flag set on a Mushroom you can't heal yourself, or if you enabled items to hit you through other flags, they still wont target you with a Shell Shield up. The same is true for enemies with Shell Shield up, you can not target them if an item has this flag. Items on enemies function as normal, they ignore this flag. Overall, this flag seems to only have any changes in game when enabled on Attacks/Items from Mario/Partner.
•Cannot Target Custom Type (TPF 0x4000000) - Gives the attack an "Unused Attack Type" property. This seems to do nothing unless the target has the "Is Immune To Custom Type (PAF 0x2000000)" flag, in which case this attack can not target that entity. If this flag is set on enemies and Mario/Partner has the "Is Immune To Custom Type" flag the enemy can not target Mario/Partner.
•Can Break Ice (SPF 0x80) - Unused, does not function by default.
•(SPF 0x200) - Unknown, only used by Gale Force.
•Play Active FX Sound (SPF 0x800) - Enables FX sounds based on which FX badge(s) the user has on. Can be enabled on partners, enemies, and items and it does function, it will only play the sounds of the equipped FX badge(s).
•(SPF 0x8000) - Unknown, not used on any attacks.
•Can Hit Clone-like (SPF 0x40000) - If this flag is enabled the attack will be able to target and make contact with a clone enemy. EX. Wizzerd or Magikoopa. The clone still disappears immediately when hit. If the clone flag "Is Clone-like (PAF 0x4000)" is enabled on an enemy that can't normally clone, they will be unable to be hit, but can still be superguarded and damaged. Healing items still work on them, status items will fail. If an enemy that isn't a clone has the flag "Is Clone-like (PAF 0x4000)" set and the attackers attack has the flag "Can Hit Clone-like Enemies (SPF 0x40000)" set then the enemy will take actual damage and must be dropped to 0 HP to be defeated, unlike a clone which fades. If this flag is enabled on offensive items they will damage the clone-like enemy, but not actual Wizzerd/Magikoopa clones.
•(TWF 0x2000) - Unknown, possibly unused, set on nearly all attacks.

-=Damage Pattern Flags=-

^ Gulp Knockback Visual (0x04) - Visual only, Gulp Knockback.
^ Remove Pokey Segment (0x08) - This is set on most Shell moves. This property is what allows Shell moves to remove Pokey segments.
^ Ultra Hammer Finisher (0x19) - Has 2 different effects. When enabled on an attack it will not play an FX sound if you have the FX badges equipped. Also the damage "woosh" visual when an enemy takes damage is slightly bigger. May have other effects.
^ Play Additional Ending Hurt Animation (0x1b) - Seems to be the finishing hit on some multi-hit attacks to ensure a 0HP target is defeated. Disables FX sounds if enabled on Mario. Enabled on Rawk Hawk's Ceiling Shake 2 and Shadow Queen's Small Hands Drag Down Attack 2.

-----Flag Potential Uses-----
This section is going to focus on possible use cases of some of these flags, since many of them may seem useless at a first glance. Any flags that synergize together will be noted together.

•Can Hit Clone-like (SPF 0x40000) and Is Clone-like (PAF 0x4000) - These flags have probably the best use case when used in tandem. First, if an enemy is set to "Is Clone-like" then they will behave similarly to a Wizzerd/Magikoopa clone in that they won't be able to be hit by anything. Star Powers, the "Cannot Miss" flag, anything except superguards with recoil will not work. Note that unlike regular clone enemies, an enemy set with "Is Clone-like" must still have its HP dropped to 0 to be defeated, they don't disappear when targeted or attacked. Next, the flag "Can Hit Clone-like Enemies" is the only attack flag that makes it possible to hit a Clone-like enemy. These two flags create a situation where a target is functionally "Immune to all except (Insert move type that has ) Can Hit Clone-like". An example, if you wanted an enemy to be a "Ghost Type" that can only be hit by a "Light Type" attack then these two flags could achieve that. The only thing that could be considered a "side effect" is that the flag "Can Hit Clone-like" will let you make contact with regular clone enemies (Wizzerd/Magikoopa), so a multi-hit move like Jump won't miss, and you will be able to use both Jump hits. However, the clone still does not drop HP and will immediately fade once the attack is finished. Functionally there is no change other than being allowed to succeed at your attack against the clone instead of missing.

•Cannot Target Custom Type (TPF 0x4000000) and Is Immune To Custom Type (PAF 0x2000000) - These flags have a use case similar to the two Clone-like flags, except in reverse. Where those two create an enemy type that can only be hit by a specific attack type, these two create an enemy type that is immune to an attack type. First, if an attack is set to "Unused Attack Type" then said attack has a new attack attribute applied to it. By default this will do nothing since an enemy must have "Unused Immunity Type" for any behavior changes to occur. That leaves "Unused Immunity Type", which makes a target have an immunity to "Unused Attack Type". More specifically, a target with "Unused Immunity Type" can not be targeted at all by an attack with the "Unused Attack Type" flag. A potential use case for these flags could be something like this, change "Unused Attack Type" into "Is Ranged" and change "Unused Immunity Type" into "Ranged Attacks Cannot Target". This gives the option to further distinguish attack types by making some targets immune to moves that are considered "Ranged". Obviously it doesn't have to be this, you can call these flags whatever, but having another attack type and immunity type creates more options for battles. Note that by default some enemies do use "Unused Immunity Type" but no attacks that I found have "Unused Attack Type", so double check enemies (Like Blooper's Tentacles) for the immunity type if you don't want it on some enemies. Also, one side effect, the "Unused Immunity Type" makes the target with that flag have no shadow. Using Blooper's Tentacles as an example, by disabling this flag on them you will be able to see their shadows.

•Target is always invisible (UAF 0x8) - By default this flag makes a target spawn invisible with an endless turn count. This could be used to create permanently invisible enemies. This would mean an attack must have "Cannot Miss" to be able to target the enemy, or superguards with recoil would also work.

•Immune to Super/Ultra Hammer Knockback (UAF 0x4000) - Makes the target immune to knockback from Super/Ultra Hammer. Can be used to make more enemies not take knockback.

•Is Undead (UAF 0x10000) - When enabled stops the target from dying when they reach 0HP. With this flag you might be able to make some kind of "Sturdy" status that prevents the target from dying for a turn? 

•Is Immune To Damage (PAF 0x800000) - This flag sets the target to be immune to taking damage. Does not prevent damage numbers from appearing, but health will not lower. Unlike "Is Immune To Damage And Status", this flag still allows statuses to be inflicted, but statuses that do damage will not deal damage. The only way to defeat a target with this flag seems to be Gale/OHKO/Fright. You can have an enemy that can only die to the insta-kill statuses.

•Is Leader (UAF 0x40000) - Designates target as a "leader". It is possible to have partners continue a battle after Mario is defeated, or you can make it so that Mario is no longer a leader and only the partner being defeated can cause a game over.
